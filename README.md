## ðŸ“Ž About application <a name="about"></a>
**Done App** is a mobile application for task management.
 An integral part of this project is application's backend that is presented in this repository.

## ðŸ“Œ Getting started <a name="getting-started"></a>

### Technical stack <a name="tech-stack"></a>

The backend is written in **Python** programming language and uses PostgreSQL to stora data.
For the sake of convenience of development, several powerful libraries are utilized. 

| Library                                        | Usage                    |
|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| [aiohttp](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/) | asynchronous HTTP server |
| [sqlalchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)      | database toolkit         |
 | [pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/)         | data validation          |
| [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/)    | testing tool             |  

## How to run <a name="run"></a>

### Run locally without Docker <a name="without-docker"></a>

#### Requirements

- In order to launch backend locally, firstly one needs to have Python interpreter
  (see [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for the instructions). 
  We used Python **3.10**, therefore we advise to stick with this version. 
  Once interpreter is ready, one needs to install the dependencies.
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- Another important requirements is to have PostgreSQL server up and running.

#### Start

To start the backend, one needs to set up the arguments.
Currently, there are the following arguments needed:
`API_HOST`, `API_PORT`, `DB_USER` `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT` and `DB_NAME`.
All of them have default values, so let us further omit some parameters.

To get the description on arguments passing, one can type `python -m backend --help`.

There are several ways how to pass these arguments:

  1) Command line  
     Example:  
     ```bash
     python -m backend --db-user postgres --db-password postgres
     ```

  2) Config file  
     Create `config.yml` file in the project directory and fill it with data (refer to `config-example.yml` for the example).
 
To run, execute the following command: `python -m backend`.
   
### Run using Docker <a name="with-docker"></a>

One needs to install `docker-compose` (see the [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)).
In this case the parameters should be passed via environment variables, see an example:
```bash
DB_USER=postgres DB_PASSWORD=postgres docker-compose up --build
```

## Deployment <a name="deploy"></a>
[Yandex Cloud](https://cloud.yandex.ru/) was used to deploy backend to the server.
